## Setup
1. Git Clone this repository in your Practice Folder.
2. Create a new file called cond_practice.py in this repository folder

## Instructions

Your job is to create a number sorter using only if statements. You will only need to submit the last file, but I strongly recommend trying Part 1 first!

**Note:** You may NOT use lists / sort() / sorted() for this assignment. Just `input()` statements, `if` statements, and `print()` statements.

## Part 1: Two Sort

Ask the user to enter in two numbers. The program will print both numbers on the same line in order from least to greatest.

### Example:

&gt;&gt;&gt; Enter a number: 10

&gt;&gt;&gt; Enter a number: 8

```plaintext
8 10
```
## Part 2: Three Sort (cond_practice.py)

Once you have completed this, you will create a second file called cond_practice.py. The idea is the exact same, but now you must sort 3 numbers.

### Example:

&gt;&gt;&gt; Enter a number: 30

&gt;&gt;&gt; Enter a number: -5

&gt;&gt;&gt; Enter a number: 1

```plaintext
-5 1 30
```
